      <p>Videography has recently and quickly become one of my passions.  I have just started filming and editing
      videos during my 3rd year in college.  Through my video classes on campus and media team from the non-profit
      organization that I am a part of, I have quickly developed many different kinds of filming and editing skills. </p>
